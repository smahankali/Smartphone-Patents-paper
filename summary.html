			<p>The Smartphone patent war as a whole is a pretty difficult one t analyze. The number of patents are increasing day by day. The total number of patents at present is fairly a large one. Therefore the number of patent wars is also increasing day by day. They are growing in a very fast pace. It is good to have patents to protect our work but the number of patents should be limited.

<p>It is unethical to use patented work but it is even unethical to get patents for everything even if it doesn't deserve to get patent. So there should be a proper way to grant the patents. There should be some more conditions to be applied to grant a patent. The patent term should be decreased and the authority of the Patent and Trademark Office to try patent cases should be expanded.
</p>


<p>The patent eligibility condition has to be refined. The patent should be granted keeping in mind the necessity of having patents to protect it.
</p>
<p>There is also a necessity to bring a provision similar to fourth fair use guideline to patent so that the patent wars can be decreased and the technology can be extended making new innovations.
