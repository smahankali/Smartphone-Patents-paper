			<h4>My Opinion</h4>
			
			
			<p>After going through various kinds of papers, blogs and material over online I realized both the positive and negative sides of the topic. The personal interview made me to check for the other side of the case. The interview with the employee also helped me to understand the position of an employee and the pressure he/show undergoes to do a particular task. It is not that easy as we do our projects by simply learning something from online and modifying the existed one.
</p>
<p>In my view it is not ethical to use others patented work and integrate that into our product. We should seek the permission of the owner and we should work on it only if they allow us and paying them the required amount. 
</p>
<p>But in this case Apple has asked Motorola to pay huge amount or should ban the Motorola's certain smartphone products from selling. But the infringement made by Motorola was minor and it doesn't deserve banning the smart phone products. This might not cost the Apple to loss its brand value or goodwill. Hence this case was dismissed as both the companies were unable to prove the damages occurred by others using the patented product.
</p>
<p>Taking all the other patent wars into account I support the decision taken by Dr. Posner.
</p>
<p>Yes, it is against ethics to use the patented work. But now-a-days there are so many patents in the country and there is no use to get patents for everything we do. The companies can get along even if we don't have that many patents. But this is not the case. Every organization is getting patents to everything they do without thinking whether it is valid or invalid to get patents.
</p>
<p>If there are these many patents to everything the scope for the innovation will not exist. Everything invented directly or indirectly depends upon the existed ones. If we stop extending the technology thinking of the patents that has the development may be ceased. But this is not the real intension of implementing patents. 
</p>
<p>So when there is no use of having patents itself it is not correct to claim some other. That's the reason Dr. Posner has asked to prove for the damages occurred. This was not proved and hence the case was dismissed.
</p>
<h4> Proposed solutions</h4>
<ul> 
			<li> Companies should think twice before applying for patents. If they think the product doesn't need to get patents that is if the usage of this product by other companies doesn't decrease the share value of the company, they should not get the patents for that. If they get patent for that kind of product they are directly obstructing the extension of the technology.</li>
			<li> Even the Organization granting patents should change their rules. They should check for the necessity of patents, if it is really worth to have patents then only they should grant the patents other than checking for the conditions like: novelty, abstract idea and non- obvious thing</li>
			<li> There is a necessity to revise the patent system in smartphone industry.</li>
			<li> The period of patent term should be decreased for inventors in mobile industries.</li>
			<li> The provision similar too fourth fair use factors should be applied to patents itself.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Four Fair Use Factors include:</p>
<ul><li>Purpose and Character of your use.</li>
<li>Nature of the copyrighted work.</li>
<li>Amount and Substantiality of the portion used.</li>
<li>The effect of your use upon the potential market for the copyrighted work</li>
<ul>
