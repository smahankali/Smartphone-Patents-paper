			<h4> Interview</h4>
			
			<p>I got a chance to interview Mrs. Deepika khammampati, Principal software Engineer with 12 years of experience in the field of mobile development. She had experience in designing, developing and testing mobile applications in android. I have chosen Deepika since she has been working for 10 years in the mobile company and she will be knowing very well how the patents can be acquired and what will be the consequences of using the developed products with the patents without taking the permission and paying the patent owner.</p>
			<p class="question">Question 1)How can we get a patent for our mobile application? </p>
			<p>Basically getting a patent is not that easy. In order to obtain a patent for our mobile app it should meet some criteria like</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It should be novel.</li>
				<li>It must be eligible for patent like it should not be an abstract idea like an algorithm or general principle.</li>
				<li>It should not be some obvious one. Sometimes we feel that this idea is innovative and creative but the people in that particular field for many years would be considering that to be an obvious one. So there will be lot of discussion and consulting before applying for patents.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="question">Question 2) What is your opinion on the ongoing patent wars? </p>
			<p>This will be an obvious thing. When someone gets patent for something and if other company or person would be developing a similar product that might be knowingly or unknowingly would create a difference. It might lead to patent infringement. But the intensity of adopting the same idea would matter here.</p>
			<p class="question">Question 3)Do you have any idea on smartphone patent war between Motorola and Apple? </p>
			<p>Yes, I do and I remember a couple of others like Apple, Samsung, HTC and Motorola.</p>
			<p class="question">Question 4)How can you handle if someone complaints against you saying that you have used their patent work even if it is your own work?</p>
			<p>Before designing something or planning to do something we cross verify our plan with existing ones to avoid these kind of issues. Sometimes same idea can be generated in a different way which we think as noval and others think as copied one. In this case we will be having a team to help us thinking in all possible ways. We can counter suit that particular suit if we are genuine.</p>
			<p class="question">Question 5)Do you think the damages have to be proven if someone else uses your patents?</p>
			<p>I think there is no necessity to prove some damage occurred or some damage to occur if someone else uses our patents because the damage may not occur right after using the work but it might occur after some time or long time.</p>
