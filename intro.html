			<h4>Introduction</h4>
			<h4>What are Patents?</h4>
			
			<p>A patent is a set of exclusive rights granted by a sovereign state to an inventor or assignee for a limited period of time in exchange for detailed public disclosure of an invention. An invention is a solution to a specific technological problem and is a product or a process. Patents are a form of intellectual property.
			</p>
			
			<p>The procedure for granting patents, requirements placed on the patentee, and the extent of the exclusive rights vary widely between countries according to national laws and international agreements. Typically, however, a granted patent application must include one or more claims that define the invention. A patent may include many claims, each of which defines a specific property right. These claims must meet relevant patentability requirements, such as novelty, usefulness, and non-obviousness. The exclusive right granted to a patentee in most countries is the right to prevent others, or at least to try to prevent others, from commercially making, using, selling, importing, or distributing a patented invention without permission.</p>
		
		<h4>Types Of patents</h4>
		<p>The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issues a few distinctive kinds of patent reports offering various types of insurance and covering diverse sorts of subject matter.<p>
<p>According to the recently issued USPTO patent document the most common types of patents are 6 types briefly described below:</p>
<h4>Utility Patent  </h4>

<h4>Design patent </h4>

<h4>Plant patent</h4>

<h4>
Re issue Patent</h4>

<h4>
Defensive Publication 
</h4>
<h4>
Statutory Invention Registration (SIR)
</h4>

<p>
Although, the length of utility and plant patent protection
(patent term) was previously seventeen years from the date of
patent grant, utility and plant patents filed after June 8, 1995
now have a patent term of up to twenty years from the date of
filing of the earliest related patent application. Utility and
plant patents which were applied for on or before June 8, 1995, and
which were or will be in force on June 8, 1995, now have a
patent term of seventeen years from the date of patent grant or
twenty years from the date of filing of the earliest related
patent application, whichever is longer.  Utility patents are
subject to the payment of periodic maintenance fees to keep the
patent in force. Patent terms can be extended under some specific
circumstances.

Eventhough Patents are broadly divided into three different categories, only two of them are appropriate for the software business. They are Utility and Design Patents.</p>
<h4>Utility Patent : </h4>

<p>
Issued for the innovation of another and helpful process, machine, produce, or organization of matter, or another and helpful change thereof, it by and large allows its proprietor to avoid others from making, utilizing, or offering the innovation for a time of up to a quarter century the date of patent application documenting , subject to the installment of upkeep charges. Roughly 90% of the patent records issued by the USPTO as of late have been utility licenses, also alluded to as "patents for innovation".
</p>
<h4>Design patent :</h4>
<p>
Issued for new, unique, and ornamental outline encapsulated in or connected to an article of make, it allows its proprietor to bar others from making, utilizing, or offering the plan. Configuration licenses issued from applications documented on or after May 13, 2015 should be conceded for the term of fifteen years from the date of allow.

<p>Software patents can protect systems, methods and functions within your app, such as user-interface features, editing functions, compiling techniques, or program language translation methods.</p>
<p>Software patents can ensure frameworks, strategies and methods inside our application, for example, UI highlights, editing methods, compiling systems, or program language translation techniques.</p>

<h3>Issues to be discussed:</h3>
<p>To secure and increment their piece of the pie, organizations granted a patent can sue to keep other competitor companies from utilizing the techniques the patent covers. Since 2010 the count of the suits, counter-suits, and complaints based on patents in the market for cell phones, and gadgets based on mobile phone OSes, for example, Android and iOS, has expanded altogether.
