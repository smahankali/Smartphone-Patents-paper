			<h4>Issues</h4>
			
			<p>In the patent war between Motorola and Apple, Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc.,</p>
			<p>"Apple claims that Motorola profited from infringement by incorporating the desirable features of Apple's patented technology into its own devices without either paying a royalty for a license to use the patents or incurring the cost of investing around them,"
 </p>
 <p>"Apple has never contended that these benefits to Motorola of infringement cannot be quantified. It merely has failed, despite its vast resources and superb legal team, to do so in a minimally acceptable manner-failed whether because of mistakes in trial preparation (which even the best lawyers can make), or because too many cooks spoil the stew (Apple is represented by three law firms in this litigation), or maybe because the infringements did not deprive Apple of any profits."
</p>

 <p>
Posner said there was no evidence of a loss of goodwill or market share by Apple entitling it to an injunction. "To suggest that it has suffered loss of market share, brand recognition, or customer goodwill as a result of Motorola's alleged infringement of the patent claims still in play in this case is wild conjecture," he wrote.
</p>
 <p>
He also cited a related reason for denying the injunction: It would likely impose costs on Motorola disproportionate to the benefits gained by Apple. "An injunction that imposes greater costs on the defendant than it confers benefits on the plaintiff reduces net social welfare," he said.<a href="references.html"> [2]</a>

</p>


 <p>
 The view that opposes Dr. Posner is that the damages cannot be proved at that point of time. The infringement may not cause any problem or damage to plaintiff in that time but in the long run it may degrade the plaintiff's business. The market share or brand recognition of Apple may not degrade due to Motorola in long run. It is not for sure but there are absolutely chances for that to happen.
</p>
 <p>And Motorola may earn more profits in the future even if that infringement may not be helpful in the current stage.
</p>

 <p>The other side of the coin is that when the damage cannot be proved and the allegements cannot be asserted the term of injunction cannot come into picture.
</p>
 <p>If an injunction causes more problems to the litigant than it gives benefits to the plaintiff decreases the social welfare and it is against the ethics.
The innovation may be ceased if we encounter every development we use similar to that of already used and patented as an infringement.
