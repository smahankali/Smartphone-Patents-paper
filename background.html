			<h2>Background</h2>
			<h4>Issue </h4>
			
			<p>In a patent dispute over technology used in android mobile phones between Motorola and Apple , Motorola Mobility v. Apple Inc. , Richard Posner, a judge on the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, said "An injunction that imposes greater costs on the defendant than it confers benefits on the plaintiff reduces net social welfare." Saying so Dr. Posner dismisses the case. The issue is to find the answers for the questions that if it is valid point to consider in taking the verdict, what is the use of patents? How patents are going to be useful anymore? Are patent rules going to be modified? Is there a necessity to apply a guideline similar to the fourth fair use guideline to the patent?

In the prior year Apple and Samsung started suing each other on many countries, keeping in mind Apple and High Tech Computer Corp. (HTC) were at that point involved in a patent battle, Motorola Mobility and Apple began a time of serious patent dispute. The Motorola-Apple patent imbroglio started with cases and cross-claims between the organizations for patent infringement, and incorporated various scenes in numerous nations as every gathering looked for benevolent discussions for contesting its individual cases; the battle included authoritative law decisions and also United States International Trade Commission (ITC) and European Commission involvement.

<h5>Motorola Mobility's Suits:</h5>
<p>
Toward the beginning of October 2010, Motorola Mobility recorded a complaint with the ITC against Apple claiming patent infringement. The dissension assertions concerned six Motorola licenses, and looked for cures of a court-requested bar on U.S. imports of infringing items, and a directive forbidding Apple from bringing in, advertising and distributing infringing items. The ITC initiated its examination a month later and Motorola in this way dropped its patent cases regarding two of the six licenses at issue.

Motorola likewise filed two more complaints for patent infringement against Apple in the U.S. Locale Court for the Northern District of (Illinois Complaints), and another complaint for patent infringement against Apple in the U.S. Region Court for the Southern District of (Florida Complaint). Both complaints affirmed Apple encroached 18 Motorola licenses. In November 2010, Motorola deliberately rejected the Illinois Complaints, (stated as counterclaims in the activities brought by Apple on October 29, 2010 in the U.S. Area Court for the Western District of Wisconsin). Later that November, Apple likewise documented counterclaims in the Southern District of Florida, affirming Motorola infringed six Apple licenses in assembling and selling smart phones, set-top boxes and digital video recorders.

Moreover, in October 2010, Motorola documented a complaint for a decisive judgment against Apple and NeXT Software, Inc. in the U.S. Locale Court in Delaware, looking for a decision that Motorola did not infringe any case of twelve licenses possessed by Apple and NeXT. Accordingly, toward the beginning of December 2010, Apple declared these twelve licenses against Motorola, Inc. what's more, Motorola Mobility, Inc. in the Western District of Wisconsin and moved for a change of scene from Delaware to Wisconsin. At last, both sides' patent declarations were in this way transferred toward the Northern District of Illinois.

Apple's complaint claimed Motorola infringed three Apple licenses with Motorola's cell phones offered in the U.S.. Apple's protestation looked for a court ordering banning imports of those gadgets and looked for an order denying Motorola from taking part in further activities identified with a similar cell phones. The ITC started examination in late November 2010; in mid-January 2012, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found no infringement by Motorola for the three attested Apple licenses; Apple recorded a request of to survey the ALJ's discoveries however the ALJ at last administered for Motorola and against Apple in mid-March 2012.
